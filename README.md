## Mock Data & Placeholders

**Mock Data**

## Note taking & Productivity

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - Obsidian is a note taking app, similar to Notion, but has a nice linking system and visuals of how concepts link together.
- [Activity Watch](https://activitywatch.net/) - Tracks time spend on differnt sites, apps and programs. You can catagorise things for work, social, etc.
- [Freedom App](https://freedom.to) - Block distractions across all devices by blocking traffic to sites that distract you. Amazing for me and really works.
- [Alfred App](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - Alfred is like Spotlight (Mac only) but better. You can create your own actions, for example, if I presss `CMD+Space` followed by typing `mdn endsWith` and press enter it will open a browser on the Mozilla Developer Network page for `String.prototype.endsWith()` so I can quickly check how a command works. The possibilites are endless.
