## Useful Shortcuts

A selection of shortcuts, these are MacOS centric, but the same should be possible on Windows.

---

**VSCode**

- In VSCode is you select a word that you want ot wrap in something, like quotes, brackets, etc. Then you can just highlight something and press the squarebracket for instance.
- `option` - While holding the option key you can select multiple cursors and type multiple lines at the same time. So if you're adding a class to multiple divs then you can do it all in one go.
- `option + command` + `up or down arrow` - Same as above but will insert new cursors above. Only works if same formatting on each line really.
- `command + d` - This is very useful as it will select the next instance of whatever you have highlighted.
- `command + f` - Find. Very useful feature is find and replace. Say you want to change all instances of a class called `headerListItem`. You could open find and in the replace part put what you want to change it to and then click replace all.
- `command + b` - Toggle the sidebar open / closed.
- `control + shift + backtick` - Open the intergrated terminal.
- `command + p` - Searches in current project, so `command + p` then start typing a file name and press enter to open it.
- `command + shift + p` - Command palette to run installed commands.
- `command + l` quickly followed by `command + o` - Will open live server for the current file.

**Terminal**

- `control + a` - Goto start of line.
- `control + e` - Goto end of line.
- `control + w` - Remove words, backwards.
- `!!` - Runs the previous command. Say you ran `/dev /devOps` as you wanted to changed the name but forgot the `mv`. You could now run `mv !!` which will complete as `mv /dev /devOps`

## Emmet

Emmet is great for the helping you complete HTML & CSS very quickly. Type your shortcut then press `tab`. The cursor will then be placed where you would logically be about to type.

</div>
```

- `ul>li.list-item*6` will output the following:

```html
<ul>
	<li class="list-item"></li>

	<li class="list-item"></li>
	<li class="list-item"></li>
	<li class="list-item"></li>
	<li class="list-item"></li>
</ul>
```
