# Useful Shortcuts

A selection of shortcuts, these are MacOS centric, but the same should be possible on Windows.

## Terminal

- `control + a` - Goto start of line.
- `control + e` - Goto end of line.
- `control + w` - Remove words, backwards.
- `!!` - Runs the previous command. Say you ran `/dev /devOps` as you wanted to changed the name but forgot the `mv`. You could now run `mv !!` which will complete as `mv /dev /devOps`
